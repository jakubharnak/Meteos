# Meteos
This project focuses on the design and implementation of an IoT
meteorological station that is capable of measuring basic meteorological units.
The station then processes this data and displays it on the web, where the user
can monitor the current and forecasted weather.
Such a weather station could be useful in subjects such as physics,
geography or computer science. Overall, this work presents the design and
implementation of an IoT device that provides useful weather information and
at the same time can have the potential of a study tool in the subjects I
mentioned above.
